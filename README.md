# BESC
*32-bit ARM-based ESC __firmware__ for Brushed DC Motors*

## Summary of this project
This project is a part of a project which intends to create a generic ESC for various types of brushed DC motors.  
This project aims to create a firmware for the ESC project.  
The source code and other resources included in this project are made public under MIT License, except for those which are subject to other licenses.

In this project, 32-bit ARM-based STM32F303RE, one of the ST Microelectronics' STM32F3 series, is used.
